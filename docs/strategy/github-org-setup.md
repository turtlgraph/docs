## Where Your 11-Chapter Encyclopedia Goes

**`turtlgraph/docs`** - This becomes your comprehensive documentation hub:

```
turtlgraph/docs/
├── README.md                    # Overview & quick start
├── volume-1-foundation/         # Your existing Vol 1
├── volume-2-development/        # Your existing Vol 2  
├── volume-3-advanced/          # Your existing Vol 3
├── api-reference/              # Generated from core
├── tutorials/                  # Getting started guides
├── examples/                   # Sample projects
└── spec/                       # Links to hyperdag/spec
```

### Strategy:
1. Your encyclopedia becomes the definitive TurtlGraph documentation
2. Reference/import technical specs from hyperdag/spec
3. Add user-focused tutorials and examples
4. This becomes your marketing and onboarding hub

The encyclopedia is actually perfect positioning - it shows you're building serious infrastructure with enterprise-grade documentation. Most GitHub projects have 3-page READMEs; you have a 3-volume technical manual.

**That's not a bug, it's a massive competitive advantage.**
